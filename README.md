# Amazon AWS = ❤️
There are different ways of creating AWS services(console, rest api, sdk, amazon cli, cdk). 
In current repository for now I am going to provide examples for 2 ways: Amazon CLI and Amazon CDK.
But in future there is a plan to support REST API and SDK ways as well. 

## Click me!
* [Amazon CLI](./amazon-cli/README.md)
* [Amazon CDK](./amazon-cdk/README.md)

## Real usage in other projects
* [Django application with AWS IAM/RDS/VPC/ECS](https://github.com/twistedFantasy/staff)

## Always ready to help
If example for some Amazon AWS service is missing just open pull request and I will add it asap. I have big amount of 
raw examples which was used in different projects, but don't have enough time to make them clear enough for this repository.
From my point of view even current examples aren't good enough, but it will definitely be better soon! 
I have a huge passion to help other engineers solve their difficulties related to Amazon AWS,
so don't worry about annoying me to provide some example :)
Any contributors are welcome!
