# Amazon AWS
There are different ways of creating AWS services(console, rest api, sdk, amazon cli, cdk). 
In current repository for now I am going to provide examples for 2 ways: Amazon CLI and Amazon CDK.
But in future there is a plan to support REST API and SDK ways as well. 

## Click me!
* [Amazon CLI](./amazon-cli/README.md)
* [Amazon CDK](./amazon-cdk/README.md)

If example for some Amazon AWS service is missing just open pull request and I will add it asap. Any contributors are welcome!
